====== OS Services ======
Angelegt Dienstag 20 Juli 2021

The operating provides various generic services to the app containers via **os-services**
Each image spec states which services the app wants to use, on deployment these are
configured for runtime use.

[ ] x11
	* access to an X11 based display server for presenting the GUI.
	* in simple cases it's the host user's X server
	* might well be an isolated instance
	* app may not take any specific assumptions on the X environment (WM, etc)
[ ] temp-homedir
	* provides app-writable home directory under /home/app
	* deleted as soon as the app container terminates
	* app may take no assumptions of available space
[ ] user-pictures
	* a plain directory with the user's picture collections
	* may have subdirectories
	* permissions:
		* list files
		* read files
		* (over)write files
		* create new files
[ ] user-documents
	* a plain directory with the user's documents
	* may have subdirectories
	* permissions:
		* list files
		* read files
		* (over)write files
		* create new files
		* dummy-write (writes to separate tmpfs layer)
[ ] settings-dir:
	* a plain app-writable directory for storing application settings
	* only meant for low volume data, mostly-read
	* included in app backups
	* mounted at [[/home/app/settings]]
[ ] cache-dir:
	* a plain app-writable directory for cache data
	* may grow as large as system (or runtime) allows
	* user may impose arbitrary restrictions at will
	* may be removed by the host at will (either completely or individual files)
	* if app uses system-notification service, it gets notification on cache purge

Planned (not yet implemented) services:

[ ] factotum:
	* credential management via Plan9's factotum server
[ ] cache-dir
	* auto-maintenance settings (eg. different TTLs per subdir)
[ ] user-pictures-thumbs:
	* automatic/on-demand thumbnail generation (and cache purging)
[ ] audio playback
	* directly play audio files (given via FD)
	* play system sounds (given by name)
	* permissions
		* allowed-always
		* allowed-focus (when app has focus)
		* take-focus (make silence others temporarily, eg. phone ring)
[ ] video playback
	* play various video streams/files in a given GL surface
[ ] system notification
	* notifies the app on certain events:
		* cache purge
		* resource pressure
		* system / UI idle (eg for doing background jobs)
		* powersave (eg when apps shall only do essential things)
	* may be user-controlled per app, thus apps cant rely on getting notifies
	* may be synthetic, means: individual apps shall behave like in certain situation (eg. sleep in order to free resources for other jobs)
	* graceful restart (on update)
		* app can do temporary quick save or store open fds to pick them up after restart
[ ] environment change
	 * user can define different environments where app can behave differently
	* e.g. stationary vs mobile, light conditions, etc
	* 2do: standardize naming / schema for common cases
